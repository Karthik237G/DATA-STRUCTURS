QUEUES:
FIRST IN FIRST OUT
Enqueue and Dequeue operations
Front/Head and Rear/Tail/Back
OPERATIONS: Enqueue, Dequeue, front()/ peek(), rear(), isFull(), isEmpty()
TYPES OF QUEUE: Input restricted queue(enqueue can be done on any one end deque can be done on any end), 
Output restricted queue(dequeue can be done on only one end enqueue can be done on eny end),
circular queue, double ended queue, priority queue(mostly used data structure as it is the base for heap datastructure)

Example problems:
return binary numbers from 1 to N: 
from collections import deque
def binary(n):
  queue=deque(["1"])
  res=[]
  for _ in range(n):
    current=queue.popleft()
    res.append(current)
    queue.append(current+"0")
    queue.append(current+"1")
  return res
